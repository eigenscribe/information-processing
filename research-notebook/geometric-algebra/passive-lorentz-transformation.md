## Section II - Minkowski Spacetime
- Einstien's two postulates
  - Principle of relativity: all inertial (i.e., non-accelerating) frames of references can be regarded as equivalent 
  - The speed of light $c$ is constant for all inertial FoRs

- Levy-Leblond argues that Einstein's second postulate is superfluous  
  - For the sake of taking an _ab initio_ approach to deriving the passive LT, we will not _a priori_ assume the speed of light in a vacuum
  - For now, we will just think of $c$ as the normalization constant that transforms units of time into units of length:
    $$x^0 = ct$$
    - Later, we will see that $c$ is indeed a natural limit arising from the composition law for velocities      
- Building a concept of spacetime _ab initio_  
  - Spacetime = 4D continuum
  - **Events** = points in spacetime
    - Represented as $$x=x^\mu\mathbf{e_\mu}=x^0\mathbf{e_0}+x^k\mathbf{e_k}$$
      - Latin indices denote the range 1-3
      - Greek indices deonote the range 0-3
    - âœ¨There is a clear distinction between a physical event $x$ and its coordinates $x^\mu$
